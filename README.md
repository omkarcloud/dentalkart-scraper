## 🤔 Questions


### ❓ Can I Interrupt the Scrape While It's Running?
Yes, you can. The scraper will resume from where it left off if you interrupt the process.

### ❓ I don't have Python, or I'm facing errors when setting up the scraper on my PC. How to solve it?

You can easily run the scraper in Gitpod, a browser-based development environment. Set it up in just 5 minutes by following these steps:

1. Visit [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper) and sign up using your GitHub account.

2. Once Signed Up, Open it in Gitpod.

3. In the terminal, run the following command to start scraping:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
  
4. Once the scraper has finished running, you can download the data from `output` folder.

Also, it's important to regularly interact with the Gitpod environment, such as clicking within it every 30 minutes, to keep the machine active and prevent automatic shutdown. 

If you don't want to click every 30 minutes, then we encourage to install Python on PC and run the scraper locally.

## 🤔 FAQs

### ❓ The code looks well-structured and organized. Most Selenium codebases are messy. How did you do it?

A: I use the Bose Framework, a Bot Development Framework that greatly simplifies the process of creating bots.

The DentalKart Scraper uses Bose to:

1. Maintain code structure
2. Save the data as JSON and CSV
3. Incorporate anti-bot detection features
4. Utilize the enhanced Selenium Driver to reduce code.

You can see `task.py` to understand the simplicity Bose Brings.

Without Bose Framework, it would be 2x more harder to make this DentalKart Scraper.

Explore the Bose Framework [here](https://www.omkar.cloud/bose/).
